# SnapTurn

This mod allows room rotation to be adjusted within Beat Saber's main menu. By default, rotations are made using the left controller's joystick or thumbpad.

## Known bugs:
* Does not move the CustomAvatar GameObject.
* Sometimes temporarily ceases to work when a new scene is loaded.
* Lacks proper optimization.
