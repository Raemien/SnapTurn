# SnapTurn
This mod allows room rotation to be adjusted within Beat Saber's main menu. By default, rotations are made using the left controller's joystick or thumbpad.

## Configuration:
* **Allow Snap Turning in songs:** Allows the player to turn within GameCore scenes. Disables score submission.
* **Smooth Turn:** Continues rotating the player until they release the turn button. Caps the maximum turn step at 5.
* **Rotation step:** Amount in degrees to rotate the player each turn.

## Known bugs:
* Mods which use tracking data rather than GameObjects (e.g CustomAvatars) may not rotate correctly.
